# Introduction

This is an extremely experimental and buggy wrapper around XLE that
allows you to add semantics to your grammars and get back the readings
for a sentence. It's still very basic and lacks a lot of relevant
features.

I have tested it only on Mac OS X, it should work out of the box on
Linux, but the get it work on Windows some stuff must be changed. If
anyone is interested in trying it on Windows get in contact with me
and we can try to do it.

# Requirements

1. First of all you will need a local copy of XLE, installed and properly
setup. 

2. The wrapper is written in Haskell so the first thing you need to
 compile it is the compiler. The best way to get it is to download the
 [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) for your 
 operating system. Install the platform and run `cabal update` to be
 sure to be up to date.

3. You need [Git](http://git-scm.com/) to get the code from
   Bitbucket. You can find Git for your platform here
   [http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/) (or you can just use the
   package manager for your platform)

4. The first piece of software you need to install is the theorem
   prover. Go to wherever you want to download the theorem prover and
   the type the following (`$` represents the prompt):
<code>
$ git clone https://giorghy@bitbucket.org/giorghy/glue-tp-library.git glue-tp
$ cd glue-tp
$ cabal configure
$ cabal build
$ cabal install
</code>
   After some warnings you should have the prover library installed on your system.



# Known Issues

1. On Mac OS X if X11 (XQuartz nowadays) is not running the wrapper
   will hang after starting XLE. Just kill it with CTRL-C and restart
   it, it should work.

2. For some arcane reason I still have to understand, if the XLE can't
   find any parse it will give you back the last successful parse
   (possibly one coming from a previous session). So if the wrapper
   gives you back a reading that has nothing to do with the sentence
   you typed, the problem may be with the parsing process.
